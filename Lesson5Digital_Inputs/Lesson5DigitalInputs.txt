In this lesson, you will learn to use push buttons with digital inputs to turn an LED
on and off.
Pressing the button will turn the LED on; pressing the other button will turn the LED
off.

Component Required:
(1) x Elegoo Uno R3
(1) x 830 Tie-pointsBreadboard
(1) x 5mm red LED
(1) x 220 ohm resistor
(2) x push switches
(7) x M-M wires (Male to Male jumperwires)

Switches are really simple components. When you press a button or flip a lever,they
connect two contacts together so that electricity can flow through them.
There are only really two electrical connections. Inside the switch package,
pins B and C are connected together, as are A and D.
The pin mode of INPUT_PULLUP means that the pin is to be used as an input, but
that if nothing else is connected to the input, it should be 'pulled up' to HIGH.
In other words, the default value for the input is HIGH, unless it is pulled LOW by the
action of pressing the button.
This is why the switches are connected to GND. When a switch is pressed, it
connects the input pin to GND, so that it is no longer HIGH.
Since the input is normally HIGH and only goes LOW when the button is pressed, the
logic is a little upside down. We will handle this in the 'loop'function.
