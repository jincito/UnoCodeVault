In this lesson, you will learn to use push buttons with digital inputs to turn an LED
on and off.
Pressing the button will turn the LED on; pressing the other button will turn the LED
off.

Component Required:
(1) x Elegoo Uno R3
(1) x 830 Tie-pointsBreadboard
(1) x 5mm red LED
(1) x 220 ohm resistor
(2) x push switches
(7) x M-M wires (Male to Male jumperwires)

Switches are really simple components. When you press a button or flip a lever,they
connect two contacts together so that electricity can flow through them.
There are only really two electrical connections. Inside the switch package,
pins B and C are connected together, as are A and D.
