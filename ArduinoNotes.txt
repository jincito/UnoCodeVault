~~~ ARDUINO CIRCUIT BOARD ~~~
It is a circuit board that has Microcontroller chips on them--integrated circuits that are like tiny computers.
	Uses a series of microcontrollers called ATMEGA AVRs
Arduino UNO Rev3 Schematic sheet
Power sources
	USB cable USBA-USB
	9 volt DC power source with a barrel jack
		has a voltage regulator that will reduce the voltage to 5 volts

Reset button
    - resets the Arduino like On/Off switch
Crystal Resonator
	Connected to the microcontroller and controls how fast the microcontroller is running

DIGITAL pins
	**0-13 pins**. used for reading on/off inputs--a button being pressed--binary input
	**TX & RX** (0-1) is for sending & receiving serial data--GPS, bluetooth, wifi modules etc...
	(**2-13**) are for digital inputs and outputs
	Pins with **~ tilde** means you can use them to output pulse width modulated square waves
	~**PWM**~: sets the voltage high and low at different frequencies. adjusts the on & off time
		- Pulse Width Modulation (PWM) is a technique for controlling power
		- PWM works with LEDs by making a fading effect of the LED by adjusting the duty cycle of the PWM signal
ANALOG IN pins 
	- used to measure continuous voltages from 0V to 5V
	**ANALOG IN** - has six inputs where you can connect/read analog inputs
		- the binary on/off? Analog is a continuous signal. there's a lot of sensors out there that have analog outputs. to read outputs use analog input pins
		- **ADC**: Analog to Digital Converter inside microcontroller. 
		- ANALOG IN pins are connected to ADC.
		- **Example of ADC**: an example of a sensor that might output a variable voltage is temperature sensor, the voltage at the output pin of the temperature sensor is going to adjust. if you have that 
        output pin connected to the ANALOG IN pin then you can read the variable voltage AND THEN use code to translate it into an actual temperature reading.
POWER pins
	- GND pin on the pin header is the lowest voltage
	- 5V and 3.3V can be used as a voltage source for small components
	- USB port can power the board thru ur computer
	-DC Jack voltage limit is 7V-20V. It is a 2.1mm Center positive plug
		- should limit voltage to 12 volts because of 5V VOLTAGE REGULATOR
		- causes lost power which = excess heat
		- can connect double a batteries or wall wart supplies
	- Recommended minimum output current of 1Amp/1000mA
	- Vin pin can power the board but has a limit (same as DC jack)
	- Reset pin: if you apply a low voltage it will reset the board (ON/OFF)
Tristate logic

Shields
	circuit boards that plug into your main Arduino and lets you do more stuff
	Adafruit
		makes shields you can control motors & servos without having to design motor control circuitry
	Sparkfun
		lets you turn your arduino into a simple phone or MP3 player
IDE
	Arduino software dev environment
	uses C / C++
	**pinMode(**led, OUTPUT) sets the led variable to be an output, this means it can now source voltage
	**Serial.begin(9600 = rate of comm)** allows us to communicate on the serial port between Arduino and our computer.
	**Serial.println()** prints something out to Serial monitor window
	**Serial monitor** allows us to display text from Arduino board to our computer
	**analogWrite**() pins capable of PWM~ it sets the duty cycle and can adjust the avg. voltage of the pin between 0V-5V but its on a scale so 0-255
	**analogRead()** allows us to use ADC to read a voltage from analog pins 0-6
	**digitalRead()** reads the voltage at button pin, checks if high=1 or low=0
	**digitalWrite()** creating an output on digital pins, either high or low, takes 2 values (pin, High/Low)
	**delay()** stops program for the amt of time(ms) passed as argument.
Resistors
	Voltage dividers
	- https://youtu.be/XxLKfAZrhbM
	- Can be use to create a **volume control circuit** or **generate reference voltages**
	- In general, you shouldn't be using a voltage divider if you have to supply more than 10 mA. 
    You can calculate Thevenin equivalent resistance of the voltage divider using this equation:
	- Calculations
		- It is the same as the parallel resistance formula
