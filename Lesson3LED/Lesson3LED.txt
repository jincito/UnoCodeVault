In this lesson, you will learn how to change the brightness of an LED by using
different values of resistor.
Component Required:
(1) x Elegoo Uno R3
(1) x 5mm red LED
(1) x 220 ohmresistor
(1) x 1k ohm resistor
(1) x 10k ohm resistor
(2) x M-M wires (Male to Male jumper wires) */

You do not need to do anything with your UNO, except to
plug it into a USB cable.
With the 220 立 resistor in place, the LED should be quite bright. If you swap out the
220 立 resistor for the 1k立 resistor, then the LED will appear a little dimmer. Finally,
with the 10 k立 resistor in place, the LED will be just about visible. Pull the red jumper
lead out of the breadboard and touch it into the hole and remove it, so that it acts
like a switch. You should just be able to notice the difference.
